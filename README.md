# CarInfo - My First Web Development Project

## 📌 Introduction
As soon as I entered my 2nd semester, I had a subject called **Fundamentals of Web Technology**, where I was introduced to **HTML**. My friends, **Soumya** and **Yashpreet**, encouraged me to try something big, and that led to the idea of creating my **first web development project** in college.

At that time, my friends and I only knew **HTML** and **frames** in HTML. We had no knowledge of CSS, JavaScript, or backend development. However, we were determined to build something interesting, so we created **CarInfo**, a simple yet effective website that showcases car details using just HTML.

## 🚀 Project Overview
**CarInfo** is a basic web project that displays car information using a structured layout with HTML frames. Since we had no knowledge of backend development, the login page does not store any credentials—it simply redirects users to the main page containing car lists and filters.

### 🔹 Features:
- A **Login Page** (without backend authentication)
- A **Homepage with three frames**:
  - **Heading Frame**: Displays the title of the website
  - **Filter Frame**: Contains filter options for different types of cars
  - **Cars Frame**: Displays a list of cars based on the selected filter
- **Filter options** redirect to different pages containing categorized car lists
- **Links to external websites** for more detailed car information

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML** (Primary language used)
- **Inline CSS** (Unknowingly used, as we didn’t realize it was CSS at the time)
- **Frames in HTML** (For structuring the homepage)

## 🎯 Learning Experience
This project was a significant learning experience for us. Through **CarInfo**, we:
- Understood the basics of **HTML**
- Explored how to use **frames** for layout structuring
- Learned about **linking pages and external websites**
- Unknowingly experimented with **inline CSS**

It was a fun and foundational project that motivated us to explore **CSS, JavaScript, and backend development** later on.

## 🔗 Future Improvements
Since this project was created with limited knowledge, there are several areas for future enhancement:
- Implementing **CSS** for better styling
- Adding **JavaScript** for dynamic interactions
- Integrating **backend functionality** (Node.js, PHP, or any other technology) for a real login system
- Creating a **database** to store car details instead of linking to external websites
